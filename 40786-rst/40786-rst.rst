   |   Black Riders came from the sea.
   |   There was clang and clang of spear and shield,
   |   And clash and clash of hoof and heel,
   |   Wild shouts and the wave of hair
   |   In the rush upon the wind:
   |   Thus the ride of Sin.

   |   Three little birds in a row
   |   Sat musing.
   |   A man passed near that place.
   |   Then did the little birds nudge each other.
   |   They said, "He thinks he can sing."
   |   They threw back their heads to laugh,
   |   With quaint countenances
   |   They regarded him.
   |   They were very curious,
   |   Those three little birds in a row.

   |   In the desert
   |   I saw a creature, naked, bestial,
   |   Who, squatting upon the ground,
   |   Held his heart in his hands,
   |   And ate of it.
   |   I said, "Is it good, friend?"
   |   "It is bitter--bitter," he answered;
   |   "But I like it
   |   Because it is bitter,
   |   And because it is my heart."

   |   Yes, I have a thousand tongues,
   |   And nine and ninety-nine lie.
   |   Though I strive to use the one,
   |   It will make no melody at my will,
   |   But is dead in my mouth.

   |   Once there came a man
   |   Who said,
   |   "Range me all men of the world in rows."
   |   And instantly
   |   There was terrific clamor among the people
   |   Against being ranged in rows.
   |   There was a loud quarrel, world-wide.
   |   It endured for ages;
   |   And blood was shed
   |   By those who would not stand in rows,
   |   And by those who pined to stand in rows,
   |   Eventually, the man went to death, weeping.
   |   And those who staid in bloody scuffle
   |   Knew not the great simplicity.

   |   God fashioned the ship of the world carefully
   |   With the infinite skill of an All-Master
   |   Made He the hull and the sails,
   |   Held He the rudder
   |   Ready for adjustment.
   |   Erect stood He, scanning his work proudly.
   |   Then--at fateful time--a Wrong called,
   |   And God turned, heeding.
   |   Lo, the ship, at this opportunity, slipped slyly,
   |   Making cunning noiseless travel down the ways.
   |   So that, forever rudderless, it went upon the seas
   |   Going ridiculous voyages,
   |   Making quaint progress,
   |   Turning as with serious purpose
   |   Before stupid winds.
   |   And there were many in the sky
   |   Who laughed at this thing.

   |   Mystic Shadow, bending near me,
   |   Who art thou?
   |   Whence come ye?
   |   And--tell me--is it fair
   |   Or is the truth bitter as eaten fire?
   |   Tell me!
   |   Fear not that I should quaver,
   |   For I dare--I dare.
   |   Then, tell me!

   |   I looked here;
   |   I looked there;
   |   Nowhere could I see my love.
   |   And--this time--
   |   She was in my heart.
   |   Truly, then, I have no complaint,
   |   For though she be fair and fairer,
   |   She is none so fair as she
   |   In my heart.

   |   I stood upon a high place,
   |   And saw, below, many devils
   |   Running, leaping,
   |   And carousing in sin.
   |   One looked up, grinning,
   |   And said, "Comrade!  Brother!"

   |   In a lonely place,
   |   I encountered a sage
   |   Who sat, all still,
   |   Regarding a newspaper.
   |   He accosted me:
   |   "Sir, what is this?"
   |   Then I saw that I was greater,
   |   Aye, greater than this sage.
   |   I answered him at once,
   |   "Old, old man, it is the wisdom of the age."
   |   The sage looked upon me with admiration.

   |         "and the sins of the fathers shall be
   |         visited upon the heads of the children,
   |         even unto the third and fourth
   |         generation of them that hate me."

   |   Well, then, I hate thee, Unrighteous Picture;
   |   Wicked Image, I hate thee;
   |   So, strike with thy vengeance
   |   The heads of those little men
   |   Who come blindly.
   |   It will be a brave thing.

   |   To my tiny throes and struggles,
   |   He sees a fool;
   |   And it is not fine for gods to menace fools.

   |   There was crimson clash of war.
   |   Lands turned black and bare;
   |   Women wept;
   |   Babes ran, wondering.
   |   There came one who understood not these things.
   |   He said, "Why is this?"
   |   Whereupon a million strove to answer him.
   |   There was such intricate clamor of tongues,
   |   That still the reason was not.

   |   There were many who went in huddled procession,
   |   They knew not whither;
   |   But, at any rate, success or calamity
   |   Would attend all in equality.

   |   There was one who sought a new road.
   |   He went into direful thickets,
   |   And ultimately he died thus, alone;
   |   But they said he had courage.

   |   In Heaven,
   |   Some little blades of grass
   |   Stood before God.
   |   "What did you do?"
   |   Then all save one of the little blades
   |   Began eagerly to relate
   |   The merits of their lives.
   |   This one stayed a small way behind,
   |   Ashamed.
   |   Presently, God said,
   |   "And what did you do?"
   |   The little blade answered, "Oh, my Lord,
   |   "Memory is bitter to me,
   |   "For, if I did good deeds,
   |   "I know not of them."
   |   Then God, in all His splendor,
   |   Arose from His throne.
   |   "Oh, best little blade of grass!" He said.

   |   A god in wrath
   |   Was beating a man;
   |   He cuffed him loudly
   |   With thunderous blows
   |   That rang and rolled over the earth.
   |   All people came running.
   |   The man screamed and struggled,
   |   And bit madly at the feet of the god.
   |   The people cried,
   |   "Ah, what a wicked man!"
   |   And--
   |   "Ah, what a redoubtable god!"

   |   A learned man came to me once.
   |   He said, "I know the way,--come."
   |   And I was overjoyed at this.
   |   Together we hastened.
   |   Soon, too soon, were we
   |   Where my eyes were useless,
   |   And I knew not the ways of my feet
   |   I clung to the hand of my friend;
   |   But at last he cried, "I am lost."

   |   There was, before me,
   |   Mile upon mile
   |   Of snow, ice, burning sand.
   |   And yet I could look beyond all this,
   |   To a place of infinite beauty;
   |   And I could see the loveliness of her
   |   Who walked in the shade of the trees.
   |   When I gazed,
   |   All was lost
   |   But this place of beauty and her.
   |   When I gazed,
   |   And in my gazing, desired,
   |   Then came again
   |   Mile upon mile,
   |   Of snow, ice, burning sand.

   |   Once I saw Mountains angry,
   |   And ranged in battle-front.
   |   Against them stood a little man;
   |   Aye, he was no bigger than my finger.
   |   I laughed, and spoke to one near me,
   |   "Will he prevail?"
   |   "Surely," replied this other;
   |   "His grandfathers beat them many times."
   |   Then did I see much virtue in grandfathers,--
   |   At least, for the little man
   |   Who stood against the Mountains.

   |   Places among the stars,

   |   Keep your distant beauty;

   |   Since she is here

   |   Since she is here

   |   I saw a man pursuing the horizon;
   |   Round and round they sped.
   |   I was disturbed at this;
   |   I accosted the man.
   |   "It is futile," I said,
   |   "You can never"--

   |   "You lie," he cried,
   |   And ran on.

   |   Behold, the grave of a wicked man,
   |   And near it, a stern spirit.

   |   There came a drooping maid with violets,
   |   But the spirit grasped her arm.
   |   "No flowers for him," he said.
   |   The maid wept:
   |   "Ah, I loved him."
   |   But the spirit, grim and frowning:
   |   "No flowers for him."

   |   Now, this is it--

   |   Why did the maid weep?

   |   A youth in apparel that glittered
   |   Went to walk in a grim forest.
   |   There he met an assassin
   |   Attired all in garb of old days;
   |   He, scowling through the thickets,
   |   And dagger poised quivering,
   |   Rushed upon the youth.
   |   "Sir," said this latter,

   |   "To die, thus,
   |   "In this medieval fashion,
   |   "According to the best legends;
   |   "Ah, what joy!"
   |   Then took he the wound, smiling,

   |   And you love me?

   |   I stood musing in a black world,
   |   Not knowing where to direct my feet.
   |   And I saw the quick stream of men
   |   Pouring ceaselessly,
   |   Filled with eager faces,
   |   A torrent of desire.
   |   I called to them,
   |   "Where do you go?  What do you see?"
   |   A thousand voices called to me.
   |   A thousand fingers pointed.
   |   "Look!  Look!  There!"

   |   I know not of it.
   |   But, lo! in the far sky shone a radiance
   |   Ineffable, divine,--
   |   A vision painted upon a pall;
   |   And sometimes it was,
   |   And sometimes it was not.
   |   I hesitated.
   |   Then from the stream
   |   Came roaring voices,
   |   Impatient:
   |   "Look!  Look!  There!"

   |   So again I saw,
   |   And leaped, unhesitant,
   |   And struggled and fumed
   |   With outspread clutching fingers.
   |   The hard hills tore my flesh;
   |   The ways bit my feet.
   |   At last I looked again.
   |   No radiance in the far sky,
   |   Ineffable, divine;
   |   No vision painted upon a pall;
   |   And always my eyes ached for the light.
   |   Then I cried in despair,
   |   "I see nothing! Oh, where do I go?"
   |   The torrent turned again its faces:
   |   "Look!  Look!  There!"
   |   And at the blindness of my spirit
   |   They screamed,
